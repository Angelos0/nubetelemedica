**OwnBackup** is the **simple database backup solution** for your **[ownCloud](http://www.owncloud.com/)** 8.1+ installation.

It's main purpose is to provide an easy solution to restore the tables of an app in case you accidentally corrupted the data or did anything you regret later.  

Place this app in your `owncloud/apps/` directory.

## Disclaimer

- Use this app at your own risk! Data loss may occur!
- This app is no replacement for a more professional backup solution!

## Features

- OwnBackup creates backups of your ownCloud tables hourly via cronjob or manually.
- You are able to choose which tables from a certain backup you want to restore.
- OwnBackup expires your backups automatically.
    - for 24h one backup every hour is kept
    - for 7d one backup per day is kept
    - for 4w one backup per week is kept
    - for 12m one backup per 30d is kept
    - for 2y one backup per year is kept
- If the Zlib library is present the backups get compressed with gzip.
- The backup should work with all databases, please report any problems. 

## Limitations

- I've only tested the app with *Cron* so far, please report any troubles with *Webcron* or *AJAX*.
- One main limitation for the size that your DB can have to be backed up will be the `memory_limit` and the `max_execution_time` of your PHP installation!
